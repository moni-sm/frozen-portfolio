        <p>
          Hi, I'm Monika SM, a passionate and self-motivated individual with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. I come from Challakere(T),Chitradurga(D),Karnataka, where I developed a love for learning and creating things. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems and make life easier. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in software development, where I can combine my creativity and technical skills to build meaningful solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I completed my Master's in Computer Science and Application from Maharani Cluster University, Bengaluru. During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development. I also participated in group events organised in collage, which helped me develop teamwork and leadership skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic journey taught me the importance of continuous learning and adaptability. I am always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set.

          I am deeply enthusiastic about learning new technologies and improving my skills. Whether it's diving into a new programming language, exploring frameworks, or solving real-world problems, I always strive to expand my knowledge. I believe in the power of self-learning and have completed several online courses in  Web Development, Data structures.

        <h2>Self-Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My journey in self-learning began when I discovered my passion for coding. Since then, I've been consistently working on personal projects, contributing to open-source, and exploring new tools and technologies. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and the satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that self-learning is a lifelong process, and I am committed to growing both personally and professionally.
